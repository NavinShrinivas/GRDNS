# GRDNS : The easy to setup DNS caching server 

GRDNS aims to be the program to run on yout DNS server when one needs fast resolve times. Consider major ISP who have their own DNS servers (Whihc may sometimes be used for tracking, but thats not the point of this project) who want to server throusands of users simultaneously. GDRNS aims to make that easy by embracing the following : 

- Clean and effective code 
- Hash based database storing records (redis)
- Multi threading done right
- Using low overhead libraries wherever possible 
- Using in memory data as much as possible when also maintaining stability
- using newer languages such as GO lang

> Note : The project as of yet has not reached a stable level and i heavily under development. If you wish to be part of this project contact me : [here](mailto:karupal2002@gmail.com)
